* RRID Metadata Schema
  This repo contains an experimental implementation for a core RRID metadata schema.
  It is basically the [[https://schema.datacite.org/][DataCite metadata schema]] with a few additions and slightly
  expanded semantics.
  
  The implementation is in [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] and uses SXML as the tree representation.
  SXML can be exported directly to XML. I have not written a conversion to json
  yet, but it should be fairly straight forward.
  
* NOTICE
  The contents of this repository are preliminary and should in no way be considered
  final or definitive.
  
* Differences from DataCite
** resource -> resourceType -> resourceTypeGeneral -> Material (new!)
   The digital resources that receive RRIDs can be construed to fit under the =Software=
   or =Services= values for =resourceTypeGeneral=. However, because RRIDs also cover
   living organisms and other 'animate' beings, the =PhysicalObject= value is not
   sufficient. Therefore we have added =Material= as an additional value which should
   be considered to cover anything that is physical and animate, or classes of animate
   or biological entities. The reason we need to add this instead of extending the
   semantics of =PhysicalObject= is that many of the resources that we need to identify
   do not have a definite confined and closed physical being, they often cover every
   member of a strain of a particular species and have a tendency to run away or get
   lost and generally defy unique identification. In addition while things like antibodies
   could be construed as 'inanimate' objects, this seems to be a stretch.
*** Guidance for dealing with dynamic data sources
    Databases should be =(resourceType (@ resourceTypeGeneral "Service") "Database")=.
    If we want to elaborate on these resource types we will add a additional tag.
** resource -> contributors -> contributor -> @ -> contributorType -> Distributor (extended semantics)
   The semantics of Distributor have been expanded to include vendors of various
   material resources such as antibodies.
** resource -> properCitation (new!)
   The =properCitation= tag is used to provide the properly formatted inline text citation for
   the resource. Authors should be able to copy and paste this directly into their paper.
** resource -> JATSCitation (experimental)
   Working on a way to get the JATS tags into the xml in a way that can be copied an pasted out.
   Unfortunately this results in =&lt;= and =&gt;= showing up in the xml version.
